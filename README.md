## Server

### nodemon

[Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) is a utility that will monitor any changes in your source and automatically resart your server.

Install **nodemon** using npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g nodemon
```



Start the server using the **nodemon** instead of **node**:

```
$ nodemon <your-app-file>
```

The server will run on `localhost:9000`
